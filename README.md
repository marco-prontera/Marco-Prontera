# Hi, I'm Marco 👋

Frontend Engineer turning complex web constraints into reliable, high-performance products.

My work sits where frontend meets real-world constraints — performance, browser behavior, third-party code, privacy frameworks, and edge runtimes.

## What I Work On

I design and build frontend systems with strong attention to performance, maintainability, and long-term product evolution. My approach is grounded in how the web actually works across the browser, the network, and the runtime.

I care deeply about rendering performance, runtime efficiency, and the impact of third-party integrations on user experience. I regularly work with performance diagnostics, custom metrics, and in-depth analysis to identify bottlenecks and drive measurable improvements.

I also invest in developer experience and tooling, using modern workflows and AI-assisted development to improve engineering velocity and system quality.

## Experience Highlights

I designed and developed the technical architecture of a Consent Management Platform certified by Google and IAB, translating formal specifications into a production-ready system used across multiple web properties. This involved consent flows, third-party orchestration, performance impact mitigation, and browser storage behavior across contexts.

Part of this work and its performance impact has been featured as a case study on :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, where I contributed to sharing insights on improving real-user interaction performance:

I’ve worked extensively within the advertising and monetization ecosystem, including integrations with Prebid and Google Publisher Tag, debugging complex runtime and delivery issues, and analyzing how changes affect performance, stability, and user experience at scale. A key part of my work is measuring the real production impact of technical changes through metrics, experimentation, and performance monitoring.

I’ve also developed native libraries for mobile applications, contributing to shared logic and performance-sensitive components used across iOS and Android environments.

While primarily frontend-focused, I’ve built supporting platform components in serverless and edge environments, and I’m comfortable working across the boundary between client, runtime, and infrastructure when needed.

## Looking Forward

I’m particularly interested in how frontend engineering, platform fundamentals, and AI-assisted workflows come together to shape the future of how we build for the web.

My goal is to keep a strong foundation in web fundamentals while evolving with the tools and practices that are redefining modern software development.
